Today

The first problems that i see is that are very bad for soviets, very good for allies and Yuri, we can balance the things in the match attacking the OP guy but that means that one of us need to sacrifice for not leave him go to late OP situation, allies can build 2 or more BF and have free repair from engineer IFV, Yuri can grind troops and get money without moving from base, soviets has nothing good in late game si i need to use early attack and spend money, but camper gone a win (the guy that not get any attack) my suggestion is reemplace the tech airport for America radar so all factions have the same soldiers and America has only one paratroop (free units are OP) like happens in funny little bigger map, the rest we can do it with our skills in game a good player can defeat a Yuri with soviets but in same skill level Yuri has advantage, also quit the wall from oil i center, make Yuri OP because can open easy and allied to using a Guardian GI and soviet need to wait to WF for try to get it and also soviet need it because in the only one chance vs OP factions so not matters if soviet are better for get the oil (build faster). You mar is pretty good ones of the best specially because we don't have farming shit like oil in base, so we need to push or die.

Okay
What do you think of the ore diggers by the oil? It's a tiny area so people have to go to center to get it, or is it too much farming even with just that?
I'll make those changes soon by the way and then I'll upload it

By ore diggers I mean these by the way https://republic.community/hosted/images/screenshots/chrome_2020-02-11_21-01-15.png

Should I replace the wall and ore diggers with gold so there's no farming at all?
Kikematamitos Today at 10:02 PM
they are great because you try to get a little of money every time, you will see the matches that i play tomorrow, ore diggers are great idea.
Ore diggers in base are farming but in lad of nobody are good idea.
Anderson Today at 10:06 PM
Okay cool
Anderson Today at 10:38 PM

Here's the new layout
I removed the wall and added gems around the oil 1x1
And replaced the tech airport with allied air command
Is it better now?
Kikematamitos Today at 10:40 PM
yES
Pretty much
Always good to have that thinks in lad of nobody that force to fight and prevent farming and camping
Anderson Today at 10:42 PM
Yeah
Then they fight over the little ore on the map
And having ore at the front of base gets a little non-farming start and makes you consider buying a miner to get it fast
Or to choose a rush and ignore ore for later
Also the gold ore is 1x1 smaller
It used to be 5x5 now it's 4x4 at every base
So less money
But more at center now for fights
Kikematamitos Today at 10:43 PM
Yes
Put a pice of meat in front of the dogs to see who wins hahaha
Anderson Today at 10:45 PM
haha yeah
I will upload it soon have not yet, I need to fix my github account then I will post the new update so it can be tried
Kikematamitos Today at 10:46 PM
